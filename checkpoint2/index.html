            Central New Hampshire Kidney Center is a dialysis unit serving the Lakes Region and Central New Hampshire since 1990.
            Being the only independent dialysis center in New Hampshire, we are able to maintain the highest quality of care for our patients in a family friendly atmosphere.
            Our center prides itself on having the highest safety records, as we have a highly experienced staff, and our Nephrologist is always on site.
            The Lakes Region area, and Lake Wiinipesaukee, are the most beautiful of resort areas, and a destination for many dialysis patients during the summer and fall seasons. CNHKC  provides care to visiting patients during their vacation.
